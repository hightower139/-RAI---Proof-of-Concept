# -RAI---Proof-of-Concept

Required modules:
paramiko



This is a project to get me familiar with GUI's, I am not a advanced level user of python or of GUI's or designs, but I am trying to work on 
this to further my skills with python and GUI's.

This is more for personal use but anyone is welcome to try and help out or put input in.

This is to create a Remote Access Interface for starting programs and reading logs and accessing the CLI (Command Line Interface) 
from your normal desktop with buttons.

The concept will have options to create fast and easy profiles that will be encryption protected, and also make it quick and easy to add 
custom buttons for your use, with simple step by step dialog boxes to get the correct info and set up the buttons to your desired outcome, 
maybe even a customization inferface to customize the GUI to your liking.

///If this works out and if I like the concept I will add more features and possibly move this over to Rust or if this ends up becoming a 
large project I may make it a Web interface///
